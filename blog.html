            <h3>India & Indians in the midst of Covid-19 Outbreak</h3>
            <p>At the point when these words show up, our 74th Independence Day will simply be behind us. Our public festivals of this commemoration of the passage into power of our Constitution have been tempered by the furious Covid pandemic. On January 26th, we previously guaranteed the occasion's main visitor, English Leader Boris Johnson, who dropped his visit as a result of the rise of another freak strain of Coronavirus in his country. In any case, for large numbers of us, the mind-set of festivity was likewise hosed by the acknowledgment that at no other time has the Constitution we are celebrating appeared to be under such danger, for certain researchers in any event, composing of the beginning of a second republic that may have effectively replaced the one set up on January 26, 1950. 


Attempted to manage this test in the new genuine masterpiece, The Skirmish of Having a place: On Patriotism, Enthusiasm and Being Indian, which looks to grow our present political mudslinging into a genuine discussion on the idea of patriotism and Indian nationhood. These are topics that have progressively gotten pertinent all throughout the planet and are challenged in contemporary India today, since some have been advancing a form of patriotism that instigates division and discontinuity inside our general public. 


Some of the national books looks for, first, to layout the development of patriotism across the world, its appearances worldwide and the different sorts of patriotism that have formed the idea. This fills in as a structure through which it presents the contemporary difficulties of patriotism and nationhood across the world and in India, especially the conflict we are seeing today between ethno-strict patriotism (in light of changeless personalities) and urban patriotism (in view of constitutions and organizations). 


The subsequent subject is the advancement of Indian patriotism from the counter pilgrim days to the municipal patriotism cherished in the Constitution. The patriotism that propelled the long battle for autonomy was established in India's revered civilisational customs of inclusivity, social equity, strict resilience, and the craving to produce a general public that permitted people to prosper, independent of their religion, standing, language or spot of birth. This established thought of India is being tested by another predominant story that blossoms with an exclusionary, forceful, public patriotism dependent on social character and the idea that India is a Hindu Rashtra. 


Simultaneously, as it is clarified during the independence of our nation, the possibility of "energy" has been re-imagined by the majoritarians. In my view, "enthusiasm" is tied in with cherishing your country since it is yours, in light of the fact that you have a place with it and it has a place with you. It prohibits no Indian. While the patriotism being advanced in India today is an aggregating vision that excludes the individuals who don't buy in to it. 


In the present India, the subject of being Indian has achieved principal significance. Our liberal constitutionalism and popularity based customs are generally addressed by rising bigotry, in which the powers released by our rulers mention to Indians what they can't eat, who they can't cherish, what considerations they can't hold, what words they should not say (and jokes they should not break). Their political assault on adversaries as "against public" disguises dictator senses. 


In the finishing up segment, I share my vision for India's future, of recovering a patriotism that reaffirms the Constitution's liberal and comprehensive thought of India and gladly declares that our enthusiasm commends pluralism. 


Despite the fact that the writers have composed a great deal in the past on the destruction unleashed on the social, and political estimations of India by bigoted and nativist powers, this Republic Day is the opportunity to reevaluate the issues spinning around the possibility of India, patriotism, energy, and the battle between the individuals who have confidence in the goals gave to the country by the establishing fathers and the individuals who might obliterate everything important about our country. I firmly believe that my words provide the commitment to this imperative public discussion. </p>

        <h3>Life is just a random cliche</h3>
        <p>May be, Life is just a random cliche! It sets us for different genres everyday. Some days are so promising, full of love, motivation and positivity while some are depressing on another level. It surely takes us to heights but may be just to give you that bungee jumping feel as we all know it can bring you to the bottom of the plane as well. Do not panic if it comes hard to you someday. Just stay there for a while, breathe, and give it some time. Soon you'll realise that you have landed safely. I know it's so confusing as most of us want to be among the most successful homosapiens of this planet because we all have got so many achievements in some way or the other which pulls us up but at the same time there are numerous obstacles that lets you down. The best part is, even after all of this, we are trying to mix up with these different moods of life without giving up on any of the phase because somewhere we too believe that Life is nothing but just a random cliche.</p>
